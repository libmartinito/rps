# Rock Paper Scissors
A playable RPS on a web browser.
## Description
This was previously an implementation of the game on the console using only html and javascript. The project was provided by [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors). An [update](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) was done by adding a user interface for a web browser with the intent of practicing DOM manipulation using javascript.
